# Loops â€“ Doing Things Again and Again

Today I learned how to **repeat actions** using loops in Python. I explored both `for` loops (repeat a set number of times) and `while` loops (repeat as long as something is true).

---

## I Learned:

- `for` loops using `range()`
- Looping through items in a list
- `while` loops and how to stop them
- `break` to end a loop early

---

## What I Practiced:

- Printing my name many times
- Counting by 2s
- Looping through a to-do list
- Making a number guessing game

---

## Portfolio Project:

I created a **Guess the Number Game** that keeps asking the user for a number until they guess right.
